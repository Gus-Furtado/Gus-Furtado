I'm an analyst in every aspect, thus the last ten years of experience across digital advertising, I mainly focus on critical thinking towards actionable insights such as media research tools, digital strategic planning, and Ad Tech tools for buying and reporting.

Iâ€™m self-motivated, and among many things that inspire me by far is team development and deep dive into time-sensitive challenges. Over the years, I found my place in utilising my analytical skills in the direction of strategic selling to support and challenge clients. After working for some of the most exciting clients such as Amazon, Samsung and Nivea you appreciated the real value of meaningful insights when it comes to advising matters like, what are the best digital media options to invest in, how to track results and the best ways to communicate complex and technical issues clearly.

At this repository you can get to know a bit about my projects.
